# BFS-Implementation
Use the BFS algorithm to perform propagation from the source to the target.<br/>
Use the BFS propagation indices to trace from the target to the source and construct the searching path simultaneously.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Develop on Dev C++

[Here is the link for Dev C++ downloading](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/)


## Running the tests

Given:<br/>
* The size of a grid map<br/>
* The coordinates of a source and a target<br/>
* A set of obstacles<br/>

Parse the input file: <br/>
```
Usage: ./bfs [input_case]
```
