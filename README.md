# BFS-Implementation
Use the BFS algorithm to perform propagation from the source to the target.<br/>
Use the BFS propagation indices to trace from the target to the source and construct the searching path simultaneously.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Develop on Dev C++
